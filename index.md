# Get Rid of Pimples

### Best ways to instantly get rid of pimples

1. Call your to be husband, and ask him for blessings. Take those blessings, add 3 tablespoons of honey, one chopped brinjal, some crushed diamonds and a ticket of "October"
movie to it. Apply it on your face and keep it for 3 seconds. This will release "tubavlatahes" enzyme in your face and your face would be free of pimples.

2. Stand below the Dhankawdi flyover and start throwing stones at random people. Once they start chasing you, run. Running will increase the blood 
flow and you will get rid of pimples

3. Take a cute teddy bear. Rub your face against his belly. Then hold him in right hand and start jumping on your top most bunk bed. Your family will be scared and 
take you to the doctor. Tell your problem to him and get rid of the pimples.

4. Throw a party and prepare pohe for everyone. Add two bottles of Jack Daniels to it. Once everyone has it, they will see no pimples on your face. 
A word of caution: Do not try this with your husband. He already finds you extremely beautiful. You might have to suffer the consequences.

5. Repeat word "CEc230osfi9shj:@LE@fsnlkdnf;33RIRONSOFNVEIVFSLKEF1" 10 times in front of mirror while holding your left leg with right eye and right nose with third
finger of your right leg.

6. Just ignore everything. Go back home, throw away the bag, sit back and relax. You would look extremely beautiful is my guarantee, and to make it genuine, I am betting
INR 1,00,000 on the same. Don't panic, it's only one sided. You don't have to pay me money if you loose.
